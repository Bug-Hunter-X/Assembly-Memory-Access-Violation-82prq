This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory outside the allocated region. The 'bug.asm' file shows the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.asm' provides a corrected version with proper bounds checking.  The issue arises from the lack of bounds checking on the array index, leading to potential segmentation faults or other unpredictable behavior. The solution incorporates range checking before accessing the array to prevent such errors.
